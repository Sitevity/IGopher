IGopher come in this first public pre-release with cross-platform (Linux/Windows at the moment) compatibility and a user-friendly terminal user interface!
At this point, the bot will first retrieve a user list from the followers of the source users that you have entered. It will then send a message according to the templates that you put to them.
In addition, you can activate certain modules such as:

- A heuristic and daily quota limiter
- A scheduler
- The use of a blacklist to avoid duplicates interactions
